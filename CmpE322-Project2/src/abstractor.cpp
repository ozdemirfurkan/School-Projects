/*
*   Assignment 2 - Abstractor
*   A simple project that create a multithreaded scientific search engine in C++
*   that queries the paper abstracts and summarizes the most relevant ones.
*
*   How to compile: "make" or "g++ -pthread abstractor.cpp -o abstractor.out"
*   How to run: ./abstractor.out input_file_name.txt output_file_name.txt
